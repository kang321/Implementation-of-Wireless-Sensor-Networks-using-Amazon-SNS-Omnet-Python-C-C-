# Implementation-of-Wireless-Sensor-Networks-using-Amazon-SNS-Omnet-Python-C/C++

 Managed a team of 3 people to design and simulate the communication between ‘Smart Sensors’ (Smoke, humidity, temperature, face-recognition) of a wireless sensor network inside a Smart Home Automation System.
 Analyzed the collected data and a notification system was implemented using Amazon SNS. The end-user was notified if the sensor values reach a threshold value.
